The polygenic effects on complex traits such as Type-2 diabetes (T2D) underpin our understanding of the genetic architecture and although estimates have been given their 
interaction with environment has not been systematically assessed. We seek to complement the literature by modelling both main and interaction effects using large 
population sample from the InterAct project, genotyped with CoreExome chips and imputed using the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel. We estimated polygenic effects along 
with their interactions with physical activity, BMI and Mediterranean diet. Consequently both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks have demonstrated substantial contribution 
from polygenic interactions, rendering insights into the complex nature of multifactorial influences on individual differences in T2D susceptibility, highlighting the 
importance of gene-environment interactions.
