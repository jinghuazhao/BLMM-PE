Mixed models with polygenci effects

This repository contains information on mixed models with polygenic effects in three directories,

1. **[JPS](JPS)**. [Mixed Modeling with Whole Genome Data](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jps/2012/485174/)
provides an overview and derived from work on analysis of data in famniles where relationship between
relatives is customarily considered yet only recently mirrored in population-based samples for which a
genomic relationship matrix (GRM) is built from genomewide data. The work was motivated by the S-Plus package
kinship developed at the Mayo Clinic and ported to R for genetic analysis workshop 14 (GAW14) later reported
in [a paper](https://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2156-6-S1-S127) in 2005.

2. **[JSS](JSS)**. [Bayesian Linear Mixed Model with Polygenic Effects](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index)
extends work reported in the above paper to the Bayesian framework, incorating a variety of implementations
which seem familiar in general statistics as with specialised software initially developed for plant genetics.

3. **[GxE](GxE)**. A GxE analysis utilises both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to the study of GxE interaction.
