Mixed models with polygenci effects

This repository contains information on mixed models with polygenic effects in three directories,

1. [JPS](JPS), [Mixed Modeling with Whole Genome Data](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jps/2012/485174/).
This paper provided an overview and derived from work on analysis of data in famniles where relationship
between family memebers is customarily included, yet now comparable to genomic relationship from
population-based samples with genomewide data as well. The work was inspired by R/kinship package originally
developed in S-PLUS at the Mayo Clinic and ported to R for genetic analysis workshop 14 (GAW14) and reported
in 2005.

2. [JSS](JSS), [Bayesian Linear Mixed Model with Polygenic Effects](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index).
This is extends work reported in the above paper to the Bayesian framework, incorating a variety of
implementations which seem familiar in general statistics as with specialised software initially developed
for plant genetics.

3. [GxE](GxE), A GxE analysis.
This work utilised both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to the study of GxE interaction.
