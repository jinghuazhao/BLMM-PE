Mixed models with polygenci effects

This repository contains information on mixed models with polygenic effects in three directories,

1. [JPS](JPS), [Mixed Modeling with Whole Genome Data](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jps/2012/485174/)
paper provided an overview and derived from work on analysis of data in famniles where relationship
between family memebers is customarily included, yet now comparable to genomic relationship from
population-based samples with genomewide data as well. The work was inspired by the kinship package
developed in S-PLUS at the Mayo Clinic and ported to R for genetic analysis workshop 14 (GAW14) and reported
in [a paper](https://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2156-6-S1-S127) in 2005.

2. [JSS](JSS), [Bayesian Linear Mixed Model with Polygenic Effects](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index)
extends work reported in the above paper to the Bayesian framework, incorating a variety of implementations
which seem familiar in general statistics as with specialised software initially developed for plant genetics.

3. [GxE](GxE), A GxE analysis utilised both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to the study of GxE interaction.
